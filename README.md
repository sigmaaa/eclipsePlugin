# eclipsePlugin
My own plugin for the eclipse with the option to add an item, and view items via tabular layout. 
Tested on Eclipse 4.14 and 4.17

The easiest way to install the plugin:
1. Download the project and open via eclipse.
2. Export project's jar via Plug-in Development/Deployable plug-ins and fragments. This must create a plugins folder with .jar file inside.
3. put the plugin folder into doping folder, which is located in the root eclipse folder. eclipse/dopins/plugins/jar
